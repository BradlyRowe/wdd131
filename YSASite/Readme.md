Subject of the Website: Roy West Stake – Young Single Adults (YSA)

Planned Content: 
	This website will serve as a central hub for Young Single Adults in the Roy West Stake. It will include a 
	welcoming main page, an “About Us” section detailing the mission and vision of the YSA program, a “Gathering Place”
	page highlighting upcoming events and community activities, and a “Contact” page for outreach and support.
	All content will be dynamically managed through an Admin panel, allowing updates to text and graphics via
	a JSON configuration file. The site will be responsive, accessible, and hosted on GitHub Pages.

Reason for Choosing This Subject:
	As a member of the Roy West community and someone passionate about both technical excellence and meaningful
	connection, I chose this subject to support local YSA efforts in building faith, friendship, and community.
	It’s a project that blends my skills in web development, database architecture, and creative storytelling-
	while serving a real-world purpose that matters to me.
